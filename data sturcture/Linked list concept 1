What is Linked List?
The link list is a sequence of nodes having a similar data type, each node contains one data object and pointer to the
next node.

A linked list is a linear data structure with the collection of multiple nodes. Where each element stores its own data
and a pointer to the location of the next element. The last link in a linked list points to null, indicating the end of
the chain. An element in a linked list is called a node. The first node is called the head. The last node is called the
tail.
